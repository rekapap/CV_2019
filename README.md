## Reka Pap

I'm a full stack developer in the making, with the background of graphic/web design and art history. I recently discovered that I enjoy coding and, after learning some basics on my own, I joined Makers Academy to progress my new carrier path. I want to learn new technologies, and work on interesting and challenging projects.

## Projects


## Skills

#### Attention to detail
During graphic design and animation work being meticulous is paramount for good results, so I got used to watch out for fine detail.

#### Creativity
While I was working as graphic designer, I had to come up novel designs constantly, that fits the customer expectations. I learnt techniques that allow me to expand my creativity. 

#### Inquisitive
I like to have complete understanding how things work, and do my research on the topic.

#### Problem solving
That's the most interesting part for me from coding. Therefore I started solving online problems to progress faster.

## Personal interest

#### Cooking, baking
I love recipes that list every ingredients in grams, even the eggs. Especially the eggs!

#### Art in any quantity
I'm big fan of Art in general, Architecture, and pop culture. I like to draw as well, and do 'things' with my hand. Once my comic was selected for publishing in an independent comic book.
