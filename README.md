## Introduction
### About me
I'm a full stack developer with experience in graphic design and animation.

### Where did my interest start
It started with building simple websites in CSS and HTML or using Joomla. Meanwhile, I was teaching myself Photoshop, Illustrator and other design software. Later on, my software engineer partner started quizzing me on various programming questions just for fun. That's when my interests fully got peaked. Since then I enjoy solving problems on various websites like Codewars, Hackerrank, Leetcode etc.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail
During graphic design and animation work being meticulous is paramount for good results, so I got used to watch out for fine detail.

#### Creativity
While I was working as graphic designer, I had to come up novel designs constantly, that fits the customer expectations. I learnt techniques that allow me to expand my creativity.

#### Inquisitive
I like to have complete understanding how things work, and do my research on the topic.

#### Problem solving
That's the most interesting part for me from coding. Therefore I started solving online problems to progress faster.
